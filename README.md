# The Intoxicator
The Intoxicator - A Raspberry Pi based cocktail making machine

Inspired by [The Inebriator](https://www.theinebriator.com/) (an Arduino based cocktail making machine), the team at [deploy.dog](https://deploy.dog) are looking to build a Raspberry Pi based drinks machine which is completely open source and anyone at home can recreate.

We'll only be using good value, readily available parts with a focus on as many parts as possible being 3D printed.
